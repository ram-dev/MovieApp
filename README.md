MovieApp is a sample project. I primarily used **AngularJS** (with **Node.js** as a backend). I used **Twitter Bootstrap** for a basic responsive website.

**User Stories:**
* User can view the list movies
  * *Note: MovieApp includes a static collection of movies. To see current movie data, check out one of my older projects which makes use of the MovieDatabase API: [Webflix] (https://demo2697834.mockable.io/movies)*
* User can view the video
* User can view movie summary
  * Movie title
  * Movie poster
* User can view history of his video
